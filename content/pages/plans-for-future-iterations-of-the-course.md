*In this section, Prof. Arthur Bahr describes how he may change the way he teaches 21L.601J in future years.*

I’m considering substantially reconfiguring the class by dropping *Beowulf*, which would become the subject of its own, six-unit readings class for which 21L.601 would be the prerequisite. There are a few advantages I can see to doing so: 1) it would let me build more slack into the syllabus, bringing it in line with my other classes (I had to drop *Wulf and Eadwacer* this semester because of my own Mental Health Day, for example); 2) it would allow us to translate a few more short poems; and 3) it would give *Beowulf* the time it deserves. Right now *Beowulf* gets just a few class periods, which is better than nothing but nowhere near enough!

One other revision to the syllabus that I’m considering would give students an opportunity to do prose composition: composing Old English sentences as a way of gaining more active control over the inflectional endings and syntactic rhythms of the language. Prose composition has a long, distinguished history in Greek and Latin pedagogy, and students from multiple semesters have proposed this innovation, so I’m going to try to figure out how to make it work.
