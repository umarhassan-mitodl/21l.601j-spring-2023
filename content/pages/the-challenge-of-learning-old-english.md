*In this section, Prof. Arthur Bahr describes the chief hurdles students face in learning Old English.*

One hurdle Old English poses is that, like Latin or German, it uses the endings of nouns and adjectives, so-called “case endings,” to indicate their grammatical function. Modern English has mostly lost its case endings, except in plurals (*cat*/*cats*), genitives (*cat’s*/*cats’*), and pronouns (*she*/*her*; *they*/*them*/*their*; *he*/*him*/*his*); but it has much stricter word order to compensate.

The many inflections of Old English—both case endings and a wider range of verb endings than we have—enable highly flexible word order, especially in poetry, so a reader needs rock-solid control of those endings to make sense of what’s going on. Yet because many of these endings are ambiguous, and the word order is often a jumble, you also need creative problem-solving and flexible thinking. Each sentence is like a puzzle, some easier and some harder. Fortunately, MIT students tend to be quite good at puzzles!
